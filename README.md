# Periodic Table Elements

This project was my first venture into React.js. It's a periodic table element checker. You input the name of the element you wish to retrieve, and it presents the element's information along with a photo of the requested element.

## Run the project

First of all, navigate to the project's root folder and execute the command `npm install`. After downloading all the dependencies, while still in the project's root folder, simply run `npm start`, and you're good to go. It will automatically open your default web browser and run the project.
